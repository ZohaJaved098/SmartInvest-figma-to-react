# Smart Invest (Figma to React Conversion)

**Smart Invest** is a responsive, single-page website developed as a practice project during my internship at **Qwerty Experts**. The primary goal was to convert a Figma design into a React application, helping me gain experience with layout structures, especially focusing on **Flexbox** for layout control and **Tailwind CSS** for styling and responsiveness.

### Project Details
- **Technology**: Built using **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive, adapting seamlessly across different screen sizes.
- **Figma to React Conversion**: This was a direct conversion of a provided Figma design into a functional layout in React, allowing me to understand the interaction between layouts, Flexbox, and responsive styling.
- **Incomplete**: Only certain sections of the Figma design were implemented, and the project is **not functional**â€”all links and interactive elements are placeholders.

**Note**: This project was created as a learning exercise to improve my understanding of layout structuring and responsiveness in React using Tailwind CSS, under the guidance of my internship at Qwerty Experts.
